              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Cloud  computing is gaining tremendous momentum in both academia and industry, more  and more people are migrating their data and applications into the Cloud. We  have observed wide adoption of the MapReduce computing model and the open  source Hadoop system for large scale distributed data processing, and a variety  of ad hoc mashup techniques that weave together Web applications. However,  these are just first steps towards managing complex task and data dependencies  in the Cloud, as there are more challenging issues such as large parameter  space exploration, data partitioning and distribution, scheduling and  optimization, smart reruns, and provenance tracking associated with workflow  execution.</p>
              <p>Cloud  needs structured and mature workflow technologies to handle such issues, and  vice versa, as Cloud offers unprecedented scalability to workflow systems, and  could potentially change the way we perceive and conduct research and  experiments. The scale and complexity of the science and data analytics  problems that can be handled can be greatly increased on the Cloud, and the  on-demand nature of resource allocation on the Cloud will also help improve  resource utilization and user experience.</p>
              <p>As  Cloud computing provides a paradigm-shifting utility-oriented computing model  in terms of the unprecedented size of datacenter-level resource pool and the  on-demand resource provisioning mechanism, there are lots of challenges in  bringing Cloud and workflows together. We need high level languages and  computing models for large scale workflow specification; we need to adapt  existing workflow architectures into the Cloud, and integrate workflow systems  with Cloud infrastructure and resources; we also need to leverage Cloud data  storage technologies to efficiently distribute data over a large number of  nodes and explore data locality during computation etc. We organize the  CloudFlow workshop as a venue for the workflow and Cloud communities to define  models and paradigms, present their state-of-the-art work, share their thoughts  and experiences, and explore new directions in realizing workflows in the  Cloud.</p>
