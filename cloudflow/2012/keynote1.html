                <td><p>Many disciplines including biology  and biomedicine have adopted the service/cloud computing paradigms, and leveraging  scientific workflows to orchestrate data-pipelines. Two US NIH sponsored initiatives,  i.e., cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) and CardioVascular  Research Grid (CVRG), have both adopted a service/cloud infrastructure that virtualizes  the access of data and computational resources, and elastically scales out for  more power.<br />
                This talk consists of  three parts. We start with an overview of the service/cloud infrastructure in  these two projects and their benefits to domain scientists. Afterwards we present <em>caFlow</em>,  a workflow toolkit for caBIG with rich  features such as service discovery, stateful interaction, data access and  security. Given the infrastructure and the toolkit, scientists  call for composition guidance to  reuse the best practices and wisdom of the crowds. To  address this research challenge we propose a network-based approach called <em>ServiceMap</em>, to provide a GPS-like  support to: 1) help domain scientists better understand various usage patterns  of the existing services; and 2) provide a system-level support to recommend  possible service compositions. </p>                  </td>

                <td valign="top"><p>“Smart City” is a hot topic of investment  and development for both Global and Chinese governments.  It covers almost all aspects of urban infrastructure and life, and needs  involvement from each department and bureau of the government. It helps to  provide smart and better services and connections with citizens and  enterprises.</p>
                  <p>Cloud computing technology represents and  embraces the latest advances in information technology, and can inject strong  and new energy into “Smart City”. Good and proper use of Cloud can provide high  quality service for “Smart City” with low cost, and really makes the “Smart  City” smarter.</p>
                  iSoftStone  is a leading IT service company in China and has gained rich case studies and  experiences in building “Smart City” applications and services based on Cloud  Computing technology. We would like to use this opportunity to share our  experience in this field and also look forward to hearing constructive advice  from the audience.</td>
