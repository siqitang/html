              <td colspan="2"><em>Dr.  Yong Zhao </em>is  a professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of  Electronic Science and Technology of China. Before joining the university, he  worked at Microsoft on Business Intelligence projects that leveraged Cloud  storage and computing infrastructure. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science  from The University of Chicago under Dr. Ian Foster's supervision, and was the  key designer of the Swift parallel scripting system. Swift is a programming  tool for fast, scalable and reliable loosely-coupled parallel computation. Yong  has published more than 30 papers in top journals and conferences, which are  referenced more than 1400 times by other scholars and researchers. He is also  one of the editors/translators for many books including “Microsoft 360° -  Success and Growth”, “How We Test at Microsoft”, “Programming Windows (5th  Edition)” and “Source Code China - The New Global Hub of IT Outsourcing”. Yong's  research areas are in cloud computing, many-task computing, and data intensive  computing. He is especially interested in providing resource management,  workflow management, high level language and scheduling support for large scale  computations in Cloud and Grid environments.  Yong is a member of ACM, IEEE and CCF.</td>
