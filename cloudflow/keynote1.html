                <td rowspan="2" valign="top"><p>Cloud  computing has emerged rapidly as a growing paradigm of on-demand access to  computing, data and software utilities using a usage-based billing model. Users  essentially rent resources and pay for what they use and everything including  software, platform, and infrastructure is as a service. In this talk, I will  give a review of supercomputing, cluster computing, grid computing and cloud  computing. Comparisons of these computing domains and programming models, their  limitations and potential solutions will be included in this talk. In  particular, I will point out the shortcomings and limitations of current cloud  computing programming models and propose possible solutions. Current MapReduce  model and its variants have succeeded in data-parallel applications such as  database operations and web searching; however, they are still not effective  for handling complex data and task dependencies in many compute-intensive applications such as graph  applications and data analytics problems. We propose several approaches to this problem  through extension of current programming models, automatic translation from  sequential codes to cloud codes, detection of data and task parallelism and effective scheduling on cloud programming models. Some preliminary theoretical and experimental results will also be  reported in this talk. </p>

                <td valign="top"><p>The results of the SHIWA and SCI-BUS projects open a new horizon for research communities who would like to use their workflows in collaboration with other workflow user communities and would like to run their workflows in heterogeneous multi-cloud systems. There is a large number of different workflow systems (ASKALON, Galaxy, Kepler, Moteur, Taverna, Triana, WS-PGRADE, etc.) widely used by different user communities. Before the SHIWA project these workflow user communities were typically isolated not able to collaborate via their workflows. The SHIWA consortium has created the SHIWA Workflow Repository to enable publish and share all these types of workflows and the SHIWA Portal and SHIWA Desktop to enable integrate them into complex meta-workflows based on the Coarse-Grained Interoperability (CGI) and Fine-Grained Interoperability (FGI) concept. The DCI Bridge developed by SHIWA enables the execution of these workflows in many different distributed computing infrastructures including grids (ARC, gLite, Globus, UNICORE), desktop grids (BOINC) and clusters (PBS, LSF, Condor). Within the SCI-BUS project DCI Bridge was extended with clouds (Amazon, Eucalyptus, IBM, OpenNebula, OpenStack) via the CloudBroker Platform. As a result there are many possibilities for workflow users to combine their workflows with other workflows and run these complex meta-workflows in heterogeneous multi-cloud systems or in hybrid grid-cloud systems. For example, a Taverna user can easily create a meta-workflow that runs a Kepler workflow as a node of the Taverna workflow and execute this meta-workflow in a hybrid cloud-grid system where the Kepler workflow runs in a Globus grid and the Taverna nodes run in OpenStack and OpenNebula clouds as web services. The talk will explain in detail those technical innovations of SHIWA and SCI-BUS that together resulted in such a flexible workflow building and execution environment.</p>                </td>
